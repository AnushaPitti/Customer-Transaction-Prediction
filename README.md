This project focuses on analyzing customer data to predict whether a customer will make future transactions.
It begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA), where missing values, distributions, and relationships between features are examined using statistical and visualization techniques. After data preprocessing, a classification model is built using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in customer behavior. 
The model is then evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to measure its effectiveness.
The final outcome helps banks improve customer targeting and decision-making, optimizing business strategies for better customer engagement
